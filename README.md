<h1>GALFIT Website</h1)
<h2>Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development</h2>
For this second milestone project, I decided to build this  website as an avid fitness enthusiast. I have always been into all things gym, nutrition and recuperation related and often google new activities, sources of nutrition and sports massage etc. in my area.
I beleived a website where all these sources could be found at a glance would be useful for Galway City where I currently live.
The Galway Fitness website or GALFIT as I've abrieviated it for this project, was designed for this purpose. A hub for all things fitness related.  

<h2>UX</h2>
My aim was to provide visitors with a simple to use website, easy to navigate menus and with a click to bring up all the locations of the health activity of their choice. 
Below the navigation bar I positioned the map taking up the full page. The idea to add an embedded webpage next to the map that would open the website of that activity was planned but due to time constraints was pulled.

I also added an infowindow to the markers on the map. Therefore, when a user clicks on a marker at their prefered location an infowindow pops up with the name of the company and a link to their website they can click on. As mentioned above this was meant to appear embedded
in the website but was decided due to time constraints to leave it open in a new tab.

Social Media links are added to the bottom so new businesses can get in contact to have their location and website added.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

In this project I used:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Lanhuage)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)


Other tehnologies used:

- [Justinmind](https://www.justinmind.com) for the mock-ups


<h2>Features</h2>

- An image of a Barbell grabs the users sight when logged into the website. Straight away the user knows they're on a website related to fitness. 
- A navbar below the image of the landing page grants the user quick and easy access to the locations of the Activities, Nutrition and Recuperation. These links collapse on tablets and mobile devices in order to provide a more appealing experience.
- An info window pops up when clicked on any marker.
- A link to the website for each company appears on this info window that brings the user to a new tab with the website.
- As it was planned as a one page simple to navigate website, all content can be found on the one page.
- Font Awesome icons are used to provide links to social accounts.


<h2>User Stories</h2>

- As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate and to find gyms in Galway city relavant to my specific sport.
- As I have newly moved to Galway I want to find out where the local Gyms are in the city.
- As a busy person with little time to cook for myself, I want to find out where it is possible to purchase meal plans that will deliver in the area.
- As an avid gym goer I want to know if there is any place I can buy supplements in Galway City.
- As a bodybuilder who recently injured a muscle, I would like to know if there are any Sports Massage Therapist or Physiotherapists in the area near me.
- I would like to be brought directly to the website and not have to browse looking for them and their website.


<h2>Testing</h2>

The code was checked with the following validators

- [W3CMarkupValidator](https://validator.w3.org)
- [W3CJigsawCSSValidator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

The project was developed with the constant use of Chrome Developer Tools in order to ensure responsivness on all devices. 

<h3>Manual testing</h3>

1. Navbar

    - Visit Home page from various sized screens to ensure dropdown menu works on smaller devices.
    - Hover over each navbar link to see of the effects work and the colour changes.
    - Click on each toggler button to ensure dropdown menu works.
    - Using Chrome Developer, alter the screen size in responsive mode to see if the navbar changes correctly.
    - Hover on each link to see if the effects work.
    - Click on each link to check if they have functionality and if they are linked to the correct markers.
    - Click on Logo GALFIT positioned on the left of the navbar to ensure that it brings one back to the Home page.


2. Map

   	- Click on links to websites on infowindow of markers to ensure all links bring you to correct website.

3. Footer

   -  Social media links work but for this project as the website is fictional will not bring you to any account.
